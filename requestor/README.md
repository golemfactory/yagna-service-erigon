NOTE: tests might *sometimes* fail with a slow/unreliable provider. Please repeat : )

All requests except static file request must contain a JSON body with 'user\_id': 'the\_thing\_from\_metamask'.

    GET  /getInstances      - list of all instances created by the user (includes stopped instances)
    POST /createInstance    - create new instance (this *should* use some config data from body, but 
                              currently everything except 'user_id' is ignored)
    POST /stopInstance/<id> - stop instance with id <id>
    GET  /static/<path>     - return a file from 'static' directory, on a given path
                              (NOTE: this probably should be done somewhere else (nginx?) in the final version)
                              e.g GET /static/index.html
