#   TODO - improvements
1.  Dump Batch API
2.  Add async Erigon creation
    --> run tests, check if works
3.  Use ServiceState, drop RuntimState
    (maybe we could remove the state-updating task?)
4.  Raise some exception if Golem exits without explicite close()
    (how to test it?)
5.  Why task in before_startup?
6.  Why global yem, not app.yem?
7.  Implement (or find a reason not to?) cluster.close() on services API. This is not really necessary, but
    it would allow stopping during startup (I'm not sure if we want this?).
    NOTE: I'm not sure if this is a good idea, e.g.

8.  If 7. works, remove 'STOP' command.
9.  Annotations?
10. PR
